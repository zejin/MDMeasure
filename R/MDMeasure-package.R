#' MDMeasure: A package for mutual dependence measures via energy statistics
#'
#' The MDMeasure package provides measures of mutual dependence and tests of mutual independence. 
#' 
#' @section Measuring mutual dependence
#' The mutual dependence measures:
#' - complete measure based on complete V-statistics
#' - simplified complete measure based on incomplete V-statistics
#' - asymmetric measure based on distance covariance
#' - symmectric measure based on distance covariance 
#'
#' @section Initializing local optimization methods
#' The permutation tests based on the mutual dependence measures.
